## Installing Linux for a Personal Computer on Windows 

To install Linux on a Personal Computer (PC) or external hard drive, a bootable Linux USB must first be created. To run or install Ubuntu from a USB stick, the first thing you need to do is insert a USB stick with at least 2GB of free space into your PC. The easiest way to put Ubuntu onto your stick is to use the Rufus USB installer. 
Links for Ubuntu Download and Rufus USB Installer:

		https://rufus.akeo.ie/

When both are downloaded, the application, Rufus must be opened and under the ‘Device’ dropdown your USB device should be selected. Next, you should locate the CD Rom icon which is next to the ‘FreeDOS’ dropdown, then the Ubuntu ISO, which was previously downloaded, should be located.  When found you should click ‘Open’ and then ‘Start’. 

Next the application will ask you if you want to download Syslinux Software and you click ‘Yes’.  Then another window will pop up asking if you want to write in ISO Image mode, click ’OK’. 


Next another window will appear warning you that all the data on your device will be destroyed. If you want to continue click ‘OK’ to confirm. Then the image will be finished in a few minutes and then when finished, just restart your computer.

Some computers boot automatically from the USB, but if your computer does not you may need to press either F9 or F12 as soon as the computer is turning on to access the boot manager and allow your computer to boot from a USB device. 
When your computer finally does boot from the USB, you have many options. You can either run Ubuntu straight from the USB (which is not recommended), install Ubuntu to an external hard drive or partition your personal computer. In this tutorial, I will be installing Ubuntu to an external hard drive. 


When the USB boots Ubuntu you click the option to install Ubuntu. It will then ask you if you want to download updates will installing and ask you if you want to install third-party software, which is recommended to do. 
Next, the installer will ask you which option you would like to install Ubuntu. Use the checkboxes to choose whether you’d like to Install Ubuntu alongside another operating system, delete your existing operating system and replace it with Ubuntu, or — if you’re an advanced user — choose the ’Something else’ option.


Depending on your previous selections, you can now verify that you have chosen the way in which you would like to install Ubuntu. The installation process will begin when you click the Install Now button.
Ubuntu needs about 4.5 GB to install, so add a few extra GB to allow for your files.


Next the installer will just verify that your location is correct for the correct time zone. Then it will ask for your preferred keyboard layout. Lastly, it’s going to ask for your login and password. Then the system will install Ubuntu, this may take some time. When finish the computer can be restarted and Ubuntu can be booted from either the external hard drive or partitioned PC.
