## Linux Installation

The Linux installation will depend on the hardware you are installing it on. The hardware device will also limit you on the distrubution of linux you are using. For example the Odroid will be running Linux - Ubuntu Mate while the Nvidia will be running Linux - Ubuntu TLS. Nevertheless you are able to install ROS on both linux distributions.

		Desktops/Laptops - Ubuntu 16.04 TLS
		Raspberry Pi - Ubuntu Mate
		Odroid - Ubuntu Mate
		Nvidia TK1 - Ubuntu 16.04 TLS

### Linux Commands

There are a few Linux Terminal commands that everyone should know. First open a terminal window. When a terminal window first open it is in the home directory of the computer.

To move from one folder or directory to another you use the command:

		$ cd {directory_name}

cd or change directory allows you to move to other directories.

To see the content in a directory you can use the command:

		$ ls

ls or list directory shows all the folders and files you have access to from your current directory.

If you would like to know all the directories you have navigated through to get to where you are you can use the command:

		$ pwd

To create a new directory you can use the command:

		$ mkdir {folder_name}

Note that this folder will be created in the directory you are in when typing out this command.

These are only a few of the Linux Terminal Commands. For more commands you can search on google for "Linux Bash Shell Commands" or you can look at the following [link](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf).
